# Jedlix SDK

Jedlix SDK is part of our smart charging platform.

You can use it to connect a vehicle or charger manufacturer account to a user in the Jedlix [Smart Charging API](https://api.jedlix.com/). It presents a view to select a vehicle or charger and authenticate with the manufacturer account.

## Requirements

- Android SDK 21+

## Installation

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("com.jedlix:sdk:1.7.0")
}
```

## Usage

When you sign up for a [Smart Charging API](https://api.jedlix.com/) account, you get a custom `baseURL` and `apiKey`. Configure the SDK with these values and an `Authentication` implementation. You can also provide custom HTTP headers. API key is not required if you use your own base URL.

```kotlin
import com.jedlix.sdk.JedlixSDK

JedlixSDK.configure(
    /* Base URL */,
    /* Headers */,
    /* API key */,
    /* Authentication implementation */
)
```

`Authentication` provides your access token to the SDK. When the token becomes invalid, you should renew it before returning in `getAccessToken`.

```kotlin
interface Authentication {
    suspend fun getAccessToken(): String?
}
```

To start a vehicle connect session, register a `ConnectSessionManager` in the `onCreate` callback of your activity and call `startConnectSession(userIdentifier, ConnectSessionType.Vehicle)`:

```kotlin
class SomeActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        val connectSessionManager = registerConnectSessionManager { result ->
            // continue when ConnectSessionActivity finishes
        }

        findViewById<View>(R.id.some_button).setOnClickListener {
            connectSessionManager.startConnectSession(
                "<USER ID>",
                ConnectSessionType.Vehicle
            )
        }
    }
}
```

To start a connect session for a selected vehicle, you need to specify the vehicle identifier:

```kotlin
connectSessionManager.startConnectSession(
    "<USER ID>",
    ConnectSessionType.SelectedVehicle("<VEHICLE ID>")
)
```

To start a charger connect session, you need to specify a charging location identifier:

```swift
connectSessionManager.startConnectSession(
    "<USER ID>",
    ConnectSessionType.Charger("<CHARGING LOCATION ID>")
)
```

A user might leave the app at any moment. If the connect session hasn't been finished, you should resume by providing a session identifier you obtain from the Smart Charging API:

```kotlin
connectSessionManager.resumeConnectSession(
    "<USER ID>",
    "<CONNECT SESSION ID>"
)
```

### Logging

By default the SDK logs only errors. To change it, update `JedlixSDK.logLevel`:

- `LogLevel.ALL` logs errors and debug logs
- `LogLevel.ERRORS` logs only errors
- `LogLevel.NONE` logs nothing

## Example

See the included example to learn how to use the SDK.

Open `ExampleApplication.kt` and specify your `baseURL` and `apiKey`:

```kotlin
baseURL = URL("<YOUR BASE URL>")
apiKey = "<YOUR API KEY>"
```

(Optional) If you use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), you can uncomment the following code to authenticate with an Auth0 account directly, assuming the user identifier is stored in JWT body under `userIdentifierKey`.

```kotlin
authentication = Auth0Authentication(
    "<AUTH0 CLIENT ID>",
    "<AUTH0 DOMAIN>",
    "<AUTH0 AUDIENCE>",
    "<USER IDENTIFIER KEY>",
    coroutineScope,
    this
)
```

## Release
Release a new version of the sdk can be done in 6 steps:
- Make the changes you need, bump the sdk version and create a PR.
- Merge the PR and let the `Publish` pipeline do its job.
- Go to this swagger [page](https://ossrh-staging-api.central.sonatype.com/swagger-ui/#/default/manual_drop_repository) and:
  - Make a base64 string of "sonatypeCentralUserToken:sonatypeCentralUserTokenPassword" that can be found with that name on 1Password and authenticate in swagger.
  - Do the GET call `/manual/search/repositories` with `profile_id = com.jedlix`, `state=any`, `ip=any`.
  - Copy the returned key.
  - Do the POST call `/manual/upload/repository/{repository_key}` with the key you just copied and `publishing_type=user_managed`.
- Then go to the sonatype [page](https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/deployments) and deploy the new version.
